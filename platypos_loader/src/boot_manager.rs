//! OS Boot Manager
//!
//! The `BootManager` represents the multi-stage process of loading and booting PlatypOS using the
//! typestate pattern.
//!
//! Booting consists of the following stages:
//!
//! - Stage 0: Creating the `BootManager`
//! - Stage 1: Mapping the UEFI address space. In order to context switch from the loader to the
//!   kernel, both must be in the same address space. We can rely on the fact that UEFI uses
//!   identity mapping and the kernel is in high memory, so the two do not overlap. To keep things
//!   simple, we use 1 GiB huge pages for the identity mapping. That means discarding granular
//!   page permissions, which is... a bit sketchy, but it's probably fine for now ðŸ¤ž
//! - Stage 2: Loading the kernel image. This stage uses UEFI boot services to read the kernel ELF
//!   image from disk and map it into the boot address space.
//! - Stage 3: Exiting UEFI boot services. We have to exit boot services at some point and create
//!   the final memory map. Note that we can't allocate memory or log after this, as doing those
//!   relies on boot services.
//! - Stage 4: Handoff! Now that everything's ready, we can jump into the kernel!
